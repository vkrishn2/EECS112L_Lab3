Note: Symbol # after min delay cost means estimated hold TNS across all active scenarios 


  Optimization Complete
  ---------------------
Warning: Design 'riscv' contains 1 high-fanout nets. A fanout number of 1000 will be used for delay calculations involving these nets. (TIM-134)
     Net 'dp/data_mem/clk': 16992 load(s), 1 driver(s)
Information: State dependent leakage is now switched from off to on.
Information: Propagating switching activity (low effort zero delay simulation). (PWR-6)
Warning: Design has unannotated black box outputs. (PWR-428)
